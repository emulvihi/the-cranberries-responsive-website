# The Cranberries Responsive Website

### What does it do and what need does it fulfill?

This project uses the skills learned so far in the course, combining HTML, CSS and User-Centric Front-End Development to create a mobile-first responsive site for the band The Cranberries. It fulfills fans' and promoters' needs by providing the ability for them to get in contact with the band, find out tour info, listen to The Cranberries' music as well as watch a video of it.

### Project Functionality

The website is fully responsive and on laptop and larger screens there is some extra content (Extra product cards in the Merch section).
The navigation links, including logo, and social links are functional. There are two forms (Contact and Email subscription) which are not functional as they do not send their data to any database or external email.

### Technologies Used

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Bootstrap 4
4. Javascript
5. JQuery
4. Bash
5. Ubuntu
6. Git
7. Github
8. Cloud9 IDE
9. Google Chrome Developer Tools

### Deployment

The website was built using the Cloud9 IDE, version control was done using a local Git directory which was then pushed to Github using Ubuntu/ Bash. It was then made live using Github Pages and can be seen at: https://emulvihi.github.io/user-centric-milestone-project/

### Testing

The site was tested on a large range of screen sizes (including the Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 5/ SE, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop) using Chrome Developer Tools both locally and on Github Pages. All interactive functionality was tested, incorporating links, carousel controls, music streaming and video players and forms.

### Credits

The music section of the site is based off the same section in the Milestone Project done by Github user "aleesang". It can be found here: https://aleesang.github.io/milestone-project-one/. I modified its content and changed some of its code in order to better fit the semantics of my site.

### User Experience (UX)

During my first project meeting with my mentor, he pointed out that the layout of my site was rather random and did not have the experience of the end user in mind. In order to rectify this, I reordered the sections of the site, including moving the Tour section to the top of the site as it contains constantly changing information that would be of paramount interest to users of the site.
