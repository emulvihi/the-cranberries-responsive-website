# The Cranberries Responsive Website

### User Experience (UX)

This project uses the skills learned so far in the course, combining HTML, CSS and User-Centric Front-End Development to create a mobile-first responsive site for the band The Cranberries. It fulfills fans' and promoters' needs by providing the ability for them to get in contact with the band, find out tour info, listen to The Cranberries' music as well as watch a video of it.

During my first project meeting with my mentor, he pointed out that the layout of my site was rather random and did not have the experience of the end user in mind. In order to rectify this, I reordered the sections of the site, including moving the Tour section to the top of the site as it contains constantly changing information that would be of paramount interest to users of the site.

### Project Functionality

The website is fully responsive and on laptop and larger screens there is some extra content (Extra product cards in the Merch section).
The navigation links, including logo, and social links are functional. There are two forms (Contact and Email subscription) which are not functional as they do not send their data to any database or external email.

### Features

1. Nav bar - fully responsive, collapses into toggle on smaller screen sizes, links scroll to relevant section on page.
2. Carousel - Shows off what band currently wants to promote. At present it shows off their new album, their merch and their new music video. It contains links to allow users to either purchase or view all of these.
3. Table of tour dates - Allows fans to see date, time and location for band's shows and allows them to purchase tickets if they wish.
4. Music section - Allows users to view album art, listen to band's music and purchase that music on Amazon or iTunes if they wish.
5. Merch section - Allows users to view items for sale on the band store with links to each of the product's pages on the store.
6. Video section - Embedded video player allows users to watch band's latest music video. Also can access the band's Youtube page.
7. Bio section - Contains info and pics that allow the users to learn more about the band and its members.
8. Contact section - Allows users to get in contact with the band about potentially hiring them. Allows users to specify date, time, location and venue size.
9. Footer - Contains form which allows users to sign up to the newsletter and social links which allow users to connect with the band on social media.

The website was built using the Cloud9 IDE, version control was done using a local Git directory which was then pushed to Github using Ubuntu/ Bash. It was then made live using Github Pages by navigating to the settings tab in the site's GitHub repository, scrolling to the GitHub Pages section and selecting the master branch as the source in the dropdown menu. and can be seen at: https://emulvihi.github.io/user-centric-milestone-project/.

If you wish to view or edit the site's files locally, navigate to the GitHub repository of the site, click the "Clone or Download" button and copy the link shown. In a terminal window, navigate to the local directory where you want to clone the repository. Once there type the command "$ git clone https://github.com/emulvihi/the-cranberries-responsive-website.git".
